C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

In C programming, stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used to organize and manipulate data.

A stack is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes the top element from the stack. This structure is called a "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. In C programming, stacks are often implemented using arrays or linked lists.


A queue, on the other hand, is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: enqueue and dequeue. The enqueue operation adds an element to the back of the queue, while the dequeue operation removes an element from the front of the queue. This structure is called a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) structure, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. In C programming, queues are often implemented using arrays or linked lists.
